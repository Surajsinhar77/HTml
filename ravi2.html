                <p>Have you ever given a thought to the fact that the note
                    book you use for writing has come to you after a long
                    process of manufacturing. It started its life as part of a
                    tree. It was cut down and transported to the pulp mill.
                    There the wood of the tree was processed and converted
                    into wood pulp. The wood pulp was mixed with chemicals
                    and finally changed into paper by machines. This paper
                    found its way to the press where ink made from chemicals
                    was used to print the lines on the pages. The pages were
                    then bound in the form of a note book, packed and sent to
                    the market for sale. Finally, it reached your hands</p>
